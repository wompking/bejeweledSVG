# bejeweledSVG
Literally Bejeweled in a SVG. Pretty buggy currently, I'm working on it. The file *may* be an HTML file, yes, but all of the work is done in the embedded SVG.

## How to play
Play progresses as per Bejeweled Stars rules. If there's no matches left, just reload the page.
Currently supports Endless mode and Diamond Mine mode (still WIP).
### Online

### Offline
Download the HTML file and open it with a browser of your choice.
